It is quite easy to deploy your YemenHR RSS Bot instance. The most recommended way to deploy it is Docker Compose: it is suitable for virtually all VPS. You may also install it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rsstt/) (tracking `master` branch) or [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/rsstt/) (tracking `dev` branch, which is always up-to-date) using pip. For developers or experienced users, dirty run from source is also an option.

For more details, refer to the [deployment guide](docs/deployment-guide.md).

## Supabase PostgreSQL Database Setup

This project has been configured to use Supabase as the primary PostgreSQL database. The local PostgreSQL container has been removed in favor of the managed Supabase database service. See [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for the original local setup instructions, or refer to [Supabase Configuration Documentation](docs/supabase-configuration.md) for details on the current Supabase setup.

## Translation

## Using the public bot

The [public bot](https://t.me/YemenHR_Bot) comes with absolutely no warranty. I will try my best to maintain it, but I cannot guarantee that it will always work perfectly. Meanwhile, you should "fair use" the bot, avoid subscribing to too many RSS feeds.\
If you use the [public bot](https://t.me/YemenHR_Bot) in your Channel, consider mentioning the bot (or this project) in your channel description (or pinned message) to let more people know about it. That's not a compulsion.
